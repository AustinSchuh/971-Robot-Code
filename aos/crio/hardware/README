This directory contains replacements/wrappers for WPILib classes.

Be careful using the classes that have the same names as WPILib ones! Many of
  them bring in the declarations for the WPILib ones which means you have to
  qualify the names of these ones (and should do the same for WPILib ones too).
The wrappers only have the functionality that is missing from whatever WPILib
  class they are wrapping (and can return pointer to). Use that pointer to do
  everything else.
