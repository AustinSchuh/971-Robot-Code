This directory contains replacements/wrappers for WPILib classes.

Be careful using the classes that have the same names as WPILib ones! Many of
  them bring in the declarations for the WPILib ones which means you have to
  qualify the names of these ones (and should do the same for WPILib ones too).
The wrappers only have the functionality that is missing from whatever WPILib
  class they are wrapping (and can return pointer to). Use that pointer to do
  everything else. They also have the more useful constructors that forward to
  the WPILib ones. Some of them also have smart pointers named *_holder_. These
  are only there to hold onto objects that WPILib needs held onto separately.
  Many of them are sometimes left as NULL depending on how the wrapper is
  created. They really should not be used for anything.
