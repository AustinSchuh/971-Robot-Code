see ../README.txt for stuff affecting crio and linux code

This folder has code for the linux box that talks to the cRIO etc. It is called the prime. We have multiple explanations for that name:
  It is the primary controller.
  PRIME/Primary Robot Intelligent Management Entity
  Represents Optimus Prime, one of the good transformers who battle the bad ones that 254 names robots after.
  It is easy to type and doesn't conflict with anything else common for tab-completion.
  It's not hardware-specific.

The code that would be useful on any linux box is in ../linux_code/.
