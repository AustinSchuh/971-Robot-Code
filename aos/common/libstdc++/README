This directory contains replacement include files for ones that the libstdc++ we're using on the cRIO either don't implement completely or doesn't have at all.
The ones in aos/crio/libstdc++ are copied from the libstdc++ that came with the compiler and tweaked so that they work.
When used for compiles not for vxworks, they just #include the usual standard library header.
