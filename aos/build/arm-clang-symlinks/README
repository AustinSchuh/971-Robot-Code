This directory has symlinks to various other files to help clang figure out how
to cross compile for arm with Debian's toolchain setup.

sysroot/ has symlinks to dpkg-cross and multilib directories so it can be used
  as a sysroot when compiling.
bin/ has symlinks to the various tools so clang can find the native toolchain.
