This directory has symlinks to various other files to help clang figure out how
to cross compile for arm with FIRST's toolchain setup.

sysroot/ has symlinks to various places so it can be used as a sysroot when
  compiling.
bin/ has symlinks to the various tools so clang can find the native toolchain.
more_libs/ has modified files of several psuedo-shared-objects which are
  actually linker scripts as distributed with the FIRST toolchain. For some
  reason, I can't get the linker to follow the documented behavior of
  prefixing the absolute paths contained in them with the sysroot, so we have
  copies which don't have any paths.
