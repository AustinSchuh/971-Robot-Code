This directory contains the stuff necessary to deal with the fact that the
  libgcc.a from the old GCC that the cRIO has doesn't have all of the functions
  that newer GCCs expect from it.

[extra functions necessary for 4.5.2]
I generated this diff with `powerpc-wrs-vxworks-nm \
  gccdist/WindRiver/gnu/3.4.4-vxworks-6.3/x86-win32/lib/gcc/powerpc-wrs-vxworks/3.4.4/libgcc.a \
  | fgrep '000 T' | awk ' { print $NF }'` (and using the same command with the
  gccdist.a from the 4.5.2 GCC.
  I then gave the outputs from both of those to diff and edited out by hand the
  functions that just moved.
__powisf2
__powidf2
__mulsc3
__muldc3
__divsc3
__divdc3
__bswapsi2
__bswapdi2
__floatundisf
__floatundidf
__eprintf

eprintf looks like it's not needed.
Compiler-RT thinks that bswapsi2 and bswapdi2 are only needed on arm, so it
  only has arm assembly for them.
