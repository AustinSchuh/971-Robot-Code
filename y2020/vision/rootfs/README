This modifies a stock debian root filesystem to be able to operate as a vision
pi.  It is not trying to be reproducible, but should be good enough for FRC
purposes.

The default hostname and IP is pi-8971-1, 10.89.71.101.
  Username pi, password raspberry.

Download 2020-02-13-raspbian-buster-lite.img (or equivalent) and edit
modify_rootfs.sh to point to it.  Run modify_rootfs.sh to build the filesystem
(you might need to hit return in a spot or two).

After confirming the target device, deploy with
  dd if=2020-02-13-raspbian-buster-lite.img of=/dev/sdX

From there, log in, sudo to root, and run /root/bin/change_hostname.sh to
change the hostname to the actual target.
