Some us are using git for managing quickly changing code. This file has
  directions/notes for setting that up.

[Cloning]
`git clone \
    ssh://username@robotics.mvla.net/www/https/git/frc971/somebody/2013.git`
  where username is your login on the server and somebody is whoever's git
  repo you want to clone

[Adding Other People's Repositories]
`git remote add somebody \
    ssh://username@robotics.mvla.net/www.https/git/frc971/somebody/2013.git`
  where username is your login on the server and somebody is another person's
  git repository

[Synchronizing with SVN]
In order to synchronize the git commits with svn, somebody has to get git-svn
  set up in their local git repo and then push/pull commits.
  To do that, `git svn init https://robotics.mvla.net/svn/frc971/2013/trunk/src`
  Then, unless you want git-svn to pull down everything from SVN again, you have
    to do `vim .git/refs/remotes/git-svn` (or whatever you name the remote) and
    put in the commit ID of the latest commit in the repository that's from SVN.
  After doing that (and a `git-svn fetch`), git-svn works like usual.
