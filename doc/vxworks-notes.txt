[Stuff Not to Use]
Their POSIX condition variable implementation is completely broken (it doesn't
  actually fix the race condition).
Pretty much all of the pthread stuff uses semMCreate(SEM_INVERSION_SAFE).
taskVarLib corrupts the heap (or something).
semMCreate(SEM_INVERSION_SAFE) fixes the usual priority inversion problem by
  creating a different one.
  See the docs on it for details.
