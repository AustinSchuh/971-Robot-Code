  Low-level hardware interface files: These are files copied (and tweaked) from
      other places that deal with the low-level hardware stuff.
	STM32F2XX.h: This has the declarations for all of the peripherial registers
	    and other stuff specific to this MCU. It was downloaded from the Rowley
		Associates STM32 BSP.
    core_cm3.h: This has the declarations for the generic Cortex-M3 registers.
	    It is a generic file that seems to be dowloadable from lots of places
		(with slight differences between each, of course). STM32F2XX.h #includes
		it.
	STM32FXX_startup.S: This defines the exception vector table and handles
	    copying data into RAM etc before calling main. It is a combination of
		startup files from the Rowley Associates STM32 BSP and generic ARM CMSIS
		packages.
    gcc_arm.ld: This is the linker script. It defines where in memory everything
	    actually goes and gives various locations names so that the startup
		script (described above) can find them and put the data where it
		belongs. It is from the Rowley Associates ARM CMSIS package.
