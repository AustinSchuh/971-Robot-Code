[files]
  Low-level hardware interface files: These are files copied (and tweaked) from
      other places that deal with the low-level hardware stuff.
	CMSIS/STM32F2XX.h: This has the declarations for all of the peripherial
	    registers and other stuff specific to this MCU. It was downloaded from
		the Rowley Associates STM32 BSP.
    CMSIS/core_cm3.h: This has the declarations for the generic Cortex-M3
	    registers. It is a generic file that seems to be dowloadable from lots
		of places (with slight differences between each, of course). STM32F2XX.h
		#includes it.
	STM32FXX_startup.S: This defines the exception vector table and handles
	    copying data into RAM etc before calling main.
    *.ld: These are linker scripts. They defines where in memory everything
	    actually goes and give various locations names so that the startup
		code (described above) can find them and put the data where it
		belongs.
