This is the README.txt file for git. If you are looking at this file and you got it through SVN, somebody messed up and it should be fixed.

This is team 971's code. We only keep code in this git repository. For details about how we use git, see doc/gitsetup.txt.

You can get to this code in a web browser through <https://robotics.mvla.net/git971> (useful for ie sending links). You have to use your SVN credentials to log in there.

aos/README.txt has some more details about what's where.
