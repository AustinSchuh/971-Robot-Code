# FRC971 "Codelab"

Welcome! This folder contains a "codelab" where you can go through the process
of fleshing out a basic control-loop using the same infrastructure as we do for
the control loops that normally run on our robots. Currently, this just consists
of a single codelab; the instructions for this are in the comments of the
`basic.h` file in this directory.
